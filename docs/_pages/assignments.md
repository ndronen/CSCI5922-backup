# Assignments

There will be approximately one assignment per week. The programming assignments must be implemented in Python using NumPy. They will vary in difficulty. In some cases, I will provide partially- or almost-working code that you will complete, because when trying to implement a new concept, it helps to be able to ignore incidental details. I might also provide unit tests to help guide you in your implementation. When I provide code or unit tests, you will get them from the course GitHub repository.

# Automatic Differentiation (AutoDiff)

Your task is to implement forward- and reverse-mode automatic differentiation. NumPy is not required for this assignment; it will use only native Python scalars.

TODO: write notebook and unit tests.

Due Monday, January 28th.

# Feed-Forward Networks 1 - linear regression, logistic regression

Your task is to implement and train two models, one for regression, one for classification.

* Modifications to the autodiff library
 * Replace Python scalars with NumPy arrays
 * Add support for neural network weights
 * Add loss functions (quadratic, cross entropy)
 * Add class for optimization (SGD)

TODO: write notebook and unit tests.

Due Monday, February 4th.

# Feed-Forward Networks 2 - multi-layer neural network, backpropagation

You task is to extend the autodiff library to support multi-layer neural networks.

Due Monday, February 11th.
