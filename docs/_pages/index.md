Deep Learning is a field of rapid change and, to date, some stunning accomplishments. It has changed the landscape of computer science and machine learning in the decade since [Geoff Hinton presented unsupervised, layer-wise pre-training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyzOUbkUf3M) to an eager audience at Google. The elements of deep learning as it exists today are

* Neural networks, for learning
* Automatic differentiation, for reliably programming neural networks
* Large datasets, for training neural networks to perform some task
* Specialized hardware, for expediting the training and inference processes

Neural networks written with auto-differentiation software and trained on large datasets using specialized hardware -- that, in a nutshell, is deep learning.

In this course, I will emphasize neural networks and automatic differentiation. By the end of the semester, you should have
* mastered, in code and on paper, forward and backward propagation in feed-forward, convolutional, and recurrent networks,
* created your own auto-differentiation software for implementing feed-forward, convolutional, and recurrent networks,
* written and trained your own feed-forward, convolutional, and recurrent networks using your auto-differentiation software,
* and implemented several recent optimization algorithms for training neural networks.

If you master this material, you will have a firm foundation on which you base subsequent work in deep learning, whether in academia or industry. In your programming assignments, you will use small networks, simple, small datasets, and your personal computer, because large networks and datasets can distract the beginner from focusing on principles, and because training small neural networks on small datasets can be done quickly on today’s general-purpose CPUs, thereby allowing you to iterate quickly. That said, I will not altogether ignore the two other elements of deep learning. I will devote some time to datasets for learning common tasks in various fields, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition. I will also introduce you to the computer architecture of various deep learning hardware — from expensive, power-hungry devices for datacenter environments to small, low-power devices for the “edge”.

# Prerequisites

Rudimentary linear algebra, probability theory, and calculus are required. Some knowledge of machine learning would be helpful.

# Course Readings

No textbook is required. Most readings will be from [_Deep Learning_](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Goodfellow et al. Otherwise we will read freely-available papers from the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/).

# Discussion and Administration

Class discussion will be done via Piazza. First [sign up](http://piazza.com/colorado/spring2019/csci5922), then use [this page](http://piazza.com/colorado/spring2019/csci5922/home).

Assignments will be submitted via the University's course management system, Desire2Learn. Use [this page](https://learn.colorado.edu/d2l/home/FIXME).

# Course Requirements

## Readings
Even though my lecture notes cover most of the material I care for you to know, the text will provide a more detailed and formal treatment of some of the topics. I'm very happy if you read the text in advance of class so that you can ask informed questions, or ask me to clarify material.

## Homework Assignments

We can all delude ourselves into believing we understand some math or algorithm by reading, but implementing and experimenting with the algorithm is both fun and valuable for obtaining a true understanding.  Students will implement small-scale versions of as many of the models we discuss as possible.  I will give about half a dozen homework assignments that involve implementation over the semester, details to be determined. My preference is for you to work in python, as we will rely on software that runs under python. One or more of the assignments may involve writing a commentary on a research article or presenting the article to the class.

Information on submitting assignments can be found here.
