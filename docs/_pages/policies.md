# Grading

Your final grade will be weighted as follows:
* 10% Participation
* 25% Assignments
* 30% Midterm
* 35% Final exam

## Participation

Asking questions and otherwise contributing positively to discussion counts towards participation, as does your participation in the class group on Piazza. If you find yourself in need of help, asking questions during class and on Piazza, and coming to office hours will create opportunities for others to help you. Conversely, if you find yourself breezing through the material, answering questions on Piazza and helping your classmates fosters a positive learning environment.

# Prerequisites

Rudimentary linear algebra, probability theory, and calculus are required. Some knowledge of machine learning is helpful.

# Course Readings

No textbook is required. Most readings will be from [_Deep Learning_](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Goodfellow et al. Otherwise we will read freely-available papers from the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/).

# Discussion and Administration

Class discussion will be done via Piazza. First [sign up](http://piazza.com/colorado/spring2019/csci5922), then use [this page](http://piazza.com/colorado/spring2019/csci5922/home).

Assignments will be submitted via the University's course management system, Desire2Learn. Use [this page](https://learn.colorado.edu/d2l/home/FIXME).

# Course Requirements

## Readings

Even though my lecture notes cover most of the material I care for you to know, the text will provide a more detailed and formal treatment of some of the topics. I'm very happy if you read the text in advance of class so that you can ask informed questions, or ask me to clarify material.

## Homework Assignments

We can all delude ourselves into believing we understand some math or algorithm by reading, but implementing and experimenting with the algorithm is both fun and valuable for obtaining a true understanding.  Students will implement small-scale versions of as many of the models we discuss as possible.  I will give about half a dozen homework assignments that involve implementation over the semester, details to be determined. My preference is for you to work in python, as we will rely on software that runs under python. One or more of the assignments may involve writing a commentary on a research article or presenting the article to the class.
