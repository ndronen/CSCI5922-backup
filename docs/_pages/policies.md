# Grading

Your final grade will be weighted as follows:
* 10% Participation
* 25% Assignments
* 30% Midterm
* 35% Final exam

## Participation

Asking questions and otherwise contributing positively to discussion counts towards participation, as does your participation in the class group on Piazza. If you find yourself in need of help, asking questions during class and on Piazza, and coming to office hours will create opportunities for others to help you. Conversely, if you find yourself breezing through the material, answering questions on Piazza and helping your classmates fosters a positive learning environment.
