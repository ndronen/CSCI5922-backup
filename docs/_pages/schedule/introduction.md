[Lecture Notes](notes/introduction.pdf)

### History of Neural Networks and Deep Learning

- 1940s 
    - 1943: [_A Logical Calculus of the ideas Imminent in Nervous Activity_](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~coquand/AUTOMATA/mcp.pdf), McCulloch and Pitts
    - 1949: [_The Organization of Behavior: A Neuropsychological Theory_](http://s-f-walker.org.uk/pubsebooks/pdfs/The_Organization_of_Behavior-Donald_O._Hebb.pdf), Donald O. Hebb
- 1950s
    - 1956: [Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence](https://medium.com/rla-academy/dartmouth-workshop-the-birthplace-of-ai-34c533afe992)
        - Attended by Marvin Minsky and others
    - 1957: [The Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron)
        - Invented by Frank Rosenblatt, a highschool classmate of Minsky
- 1960s
    - 1964: [_A simple automatic derivative evaluation program_](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=364791), Robert E. Wengert
        - Initial discovery of automatic differentiation, the generalization of the backpropagation algorithm
    - 1969: [_Perceptrons_](https://archive.org/details/Perceptrons), Minsky and Papert
        - Analysis of the Perceptron and its limitations, led to an ["AI Winter"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter#The_abandonment_of_connectionism_in_1969)
- 1980s
    - [Connectionist School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism)
    - Representation learning
    - 1986: [Backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation)
        - Rediscovery of automatic differentiation by Rumelhart, Williams, and Hinton
        - Uses chain rule and propagation of gradients to learn weights of multiple layers of neurons
- 2000s (2006-)
    - Early Deep Learning
        - Unsupervised pre-training methods
        - Contrastive Divergence for training Restricted Boltzmann Machines
        - Denoising Autoencoders, Contractive Autoencoders
- 2010s
    - Current Deep Learning
        - Ordinary supervised learning with neural networks, large datasets, and special hardware
        - Started when [AlexNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet)
            - Dataset: [ImageNet](http://image-net.org/about-overview)
            - Technical innovations: [ReLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)), [DropOut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropout_(neural_networks))
            - Hardware: [Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit)
