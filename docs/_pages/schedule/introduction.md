## Introduction

### Brief History of Neural Networks and Deep Learning

* 1940s 
    * 1943: [*A Logical Calculus of the ideas Imminent in Nervous Activity*](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~coquand/AUTOMATA/mcp.pdf), McCulloch and Pitts
    * 1949: [*The Organization of Behavior: A Neuropsychological Theory*](http://s-f-walker.org.uk/pubsebooks/pdfs/The_Organization_of_Behavior-Donald_O._Hebb.pdf), Donald O. Hebb
* 1950s
    * 1956: [Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence](https://medium.com/rla-academy/dartmouth-workshop-the-birthplace-of-ai-34c533afe992)
        * Attended by Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon, and others
    * 1957: [The Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron)
        * Invented by Frank Rosenblatt, a highschool classmate of Minsky
* 1960s
    * 1964: [*A simple automatic derivative evaluation program*](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=364791), Robert E. Wengert
        * Initial discovery of automatic differentiation, the generalization ofthe backpropagation algorithm
    * 1969: [*Perceptrons*](https://archive.org/details/Perceptrons), Minsky and Papert
        * Analysis of the Perceptron and its limitations, led to an ["AI Winter"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter#The_abandonment_of_connectionism_in_1969)
* 1980s
    * [Connectionist School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism)
    * Representation learning
    * 1986: [Backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation)
        * Rediscovery of automatic differentiation by Rumelhart, Williams, and Hinton
        * Uses chain rule and propagation of gradients to learn weights of multiple layers of neurons
* 2000s (2006-)
    * Early Deep Learning
        * Unsupervised pre-training methods
        * Contrastive Divergence for training Restricted Boltzmann Machines
        * Denoising Autoencoders, Contractive Autoencoders
* 2010s
    * Current Deep Learning
        * Ordinary supervised learning with neural networks, large datasets, and special hardware
        * [AlexNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet)
            * Dataset: ImageNet
            * Technical innovations: ReLU, DropOut
            * Hardware: Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
